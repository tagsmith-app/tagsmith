# TagSmith

**A desktop app for viewing and batch-editing media file metadata**

Organize your photo and video library by fixing timestamps and adding GPS coordinates across hundreds of files at once.

## Download

**[Get TagSmith from the Microsoft Store →](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PL73JZKCG80?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare)**

## Features

- **View all timestamps at a glance** — See filesystem, EXIF, XMP, and QuickTime dates side-by-side
- **Integrated preview pane** — Preview images and video thumbnails without leaving the app
- **Batch edit dates and times** — Copy values between metadata fields or set custom dates and times using visual pickers
- **File name parsing (Filename Pattern)** — Extract dates from filenames using a configurable pattern (e.g. `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`)
- **Sampler tools for date, time, and GPS** — Copy date/time or GPS from any file and apply it to others
- **GPS tagging** — Add, edit, or erase location coordinates with offline city/country lookup
- **Fast scanning** — Scan folders with thousands of files; subfolder support included
- **Preview before applying** — Review exactly what will change before writing to files
- **Keyboard-driven workflow** — Norton Commander-style navigation for power users
- **Customizable columns** — Show or hide columns by category (EXIF, XMP, QuickTime, GPS, Camera)
